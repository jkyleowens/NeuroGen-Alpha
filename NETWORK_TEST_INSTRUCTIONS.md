# Testing the Fleshed-Out Network Implementation

## Network Architecture Overview

The network has been implemented with the following architecture:

### Network Topology
- **Input Layer**: 60 neurons (matching feature vector from main.cpp)
- **Hidden Layer**: 512 neurons (dense processing layer)
- **Output Layer**: 3 neurons (buy/sell/hold decisions)

### Connectivity
- Input → Hidden: 80% connection probability, weights ±0.05
- Hidden → Hidden: 10% recurrent connectivity, weights ±0.03  
- Hidden → Output: 100% connectivity, weights ±0.02

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Proper Network Initialization**:
   - Random voltage initialization around resting potential (-65mV ± 2mV)
   - Hodgkin-Huxley gating variables with small perturbations
   - Structured connectivity with biologically plausible sparsity

2. **Input Processing**:
   - Feature vectors converted to neural currents
   - Rate coding through current injection
   - Multi-timestep processing (10ms processing window)

3. **Output Extraction**:
   - Membrane potential and spike history conversion
   - Softmax normalization for decision probabilities
   - Numerical stability with max subtraction

4. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Reward-modulated STDP (stronger learning with positive rewards)
   - Homeostatic scaling to prevent runaway dynamics
   - Synaptic pruning for efficiency
   - Dopaminergic modulation of neural excitability

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Build and Test (Run this in your CUDA-enabled terminal):

```bash
cd "/home/jkyleowens/Desktop/NeuroGen Alpha"

# Build the main simulation
make

# Build the simple network test
nvcc -o test_network test_network.cpp src/cuda/*.cu -I src/cuda -lcurand

# Run the network test
./test_network
```

### 2. Expected Test Output:

The test should show:
- Network initialization with 575 neurons and ~40K synapses
- Initial random output (e.g., "0.31 0.35 0.34")
- Changed output after learning update
- Successful cleanup message

### 3. Run Full Trading Simulation:

```bash
# Run with sample data
./neural_sim highly_diverse_stock_data 2

# Monitor for:
# - CUDA network initialization
# - Portfolio value changes
# - Learning progression over epochs
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Input Processing Pipeline:
1. 60-feature vector → current injection into input neurons
2. 10 timesteps of neural dynamics (RK4 integration)
3. Spike detection and synaptic propagation
4. Reward modulation on final timestep

### Learning Mechanism:
- **STDP**: A_plus = 0.008 * (1 + 0.1*reward), A_minus = 0.010 * (1 - 0.05*reward)
- **Homeostasis**: Weight scaling every 100 updates, pruning every 1000
- **Modulation**: Reward affects both learning rates and neural excitability

### Memory Management:
- All GPU allocations tracked and cleaned up
- Error checking after major operations
- Static buffers for efficiency

## Next Steps for Validation:

1. **Performance Testing**: Monitor GPU memory usage and compute times
2. **Learning Validation**: Track synaptic weight evolution over training
3. **Decision Quality**: Analyze buy/sell/hold decision patterns
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust STDP rates based on trading performance

The network is now ready for full-scale reinforcement learning in the trading environment!
