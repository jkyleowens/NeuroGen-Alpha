  * Weaken connections in the opposite scenario

* Dynamically update synaptic weights based on spike timings

### **5.2. Neurotransmitter-Based Reward**

* Central neuromodulatory module simulating neurotransmitter release (dopamine, serotonin)

* Reward signal modulates synaptic plasticity, enhancing or diminishing learning rates and synaptic modifications

### **5.3. Structural Plasticity (Neurogenesis & Pruning)**

* Dynamically adjust neuron counts within columns

* Create new neurons and synapses in response to sustained high activity

* Prune under-utilized connections to maintain efficiency
